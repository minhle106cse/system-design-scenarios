 * aborted transaction, silently. MediatR has the same weakness (behaviour order =
 * DI registration order, no validation). It is now written into one function body,
 * the way `dotnet/eShop`'s TransactionBehavior nests `CreateExecutionStrategy`
 * around `BeginTransactionAsync`, so the wrong order is unrepresentable.
 *
 * There is no `use()` and no ICommandMiddleware any more.

 * single `CommandBus<S>` instance, parameterized once at the composition
 * root, not per-handler.
