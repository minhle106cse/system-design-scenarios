 * and falls into `runTransactional` with `txScope: undefined`, surfacing at the
 * first request as an unrelated `TypeError` instead of at boot (review of
 * ADR-0005, 2026-07-30 — the same silent-to-loud gap the ADR closed for missing
 * TxScope factories, left open for a missing `kind`).

 * compensation for that flow (ADR-0005) — a saga calling another saga splits
 * that ownership two ways: the inner saga self-compensates and rethrows, and if
 * the outer handler also registers `onCompensate` for that same dispatch (easy
 * to do out of habit, since every other step needs one), the bus undoes it a
 * second time on top of what the inner saga already undid. Caught at dispatch
 * time instead of left to be found via a double-compensation bug in prod.
